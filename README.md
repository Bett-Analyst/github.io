# Project 1

**Title:** [Hospital Admission Data Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/Bett-Analyst/github.io/blob/main/Interactive%20Admission%20Dashboard.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel(Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Timelines)

**Project Description:**

This project involved analyzing hospital admission data to identify trends and patterns in patient demographics, treatment costs, and health outcomes. It is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key healthcare performance metrics. This interactive dashboard allows hospital administrators and stakeholders to easily monitor and evaluate operational efficiency, patient outcomes, and financial impact across various age groups and medical conditions.

The dashboard includes the following features:

**Length of Stay per Age Range:** Visual breakdown of average hospital stay durations categorized by age range, helping identify age groups requiring longer care.

**Total Readmissions:** Pie chart showing the proportion of patients readmitted, supporting efforts to monitor and reduce readmission rates.

**Total Cost per Age Range:** Bar chart highlighting the total treatment costs incurred per age group, offering insight into which demographics drive higher expenses.

**Average Cost per Condition:** Displays average treatment cost for various medical conditions (e.g., cancer, heart disease, diabetes), enabling comparison of resource allocation.

**Total Patient Count:** Line graph of patient volume by age group, helping to identify peak demand and service utilization.

Total Patients per Outcome: Pie chart comparing recovery versus stable patient outcomes, providing a snapshot of overall treatment effectiveness.

Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive slicers for:

**Gender:** Analyze data based on male or female patient populations.

**Outcome:** Filter by recovery or stability to focus on specific result categories.

Admission Score: Drill down using score-based segmentation for deeper analysis of admission severity and its correlation with other metrics.

**Key findings:**

**High-Cost Age Groups:** Identified the 55–60 and 75–80 age ranges as the most expensive in terms of total treatment cost, highlighting the need for targeted cost management strategies in these demographics.

**Length of Stay Correlation:** Found that patients in the 50–65 age group had the longest hospital stays, suggesting a direct correlation between age and duration of care that may require additional resources and planning.
Condition Cost Insights: Revealed that Cancer and Prostate Cancer are the most expensive conditions to treat, providing a focus for cost-control efforts and budgeting in oncology services.

**Readmission Rates:** Observed a 27% readmission rate, indicating an opportunity to improve post-discharge care and reduce avoidable hospital returns.

**Patient Outcome Distribution:** Noted that 60% of patients recovered while 40% remained stable, offering a baseline for evaluating treatment success and areas for clinical improvement.

**Age-Driven Demand:** Highlighted peak patient volume in the 50–60 age range, essential for workforce planning and optimizing hospital capacity.

This dashboard serves as a crucial tool for hospital management and healthcare analysts, offering clear, actionable insights to enhance patient care, manage costs, and support data-driven strategic planning.
